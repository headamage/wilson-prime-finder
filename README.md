# Wilson's prime number finder for the Raspberry Pi
These scripts are not meant to be an efficient way of looking for primes. They are developed as a means for loading the Pi's CPU in an educational or research context.

prime.py cheks to see if a number is prime.
sprime.py checks a range of numbers and reports the primes it finds.
mprime.py uses multiprocessing to go through a range of numbers and find primes. This can use all the cores in Pi 2.
